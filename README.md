## Creating Data Warehouse from Transactional Database

Dataset in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer), and migration from transactional to data warehouse is run using [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-ver15). The dataset is modified to have more dimension in the data warehouse.
